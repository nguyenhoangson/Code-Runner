# CodeRunner [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nguyenhoangson/Code-Runner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nguyenhoangson/Code-Runner)


Code Runner uses Docker as sandboxing environment

# Prerequisites
To use CodeRunner package, it requires the following dependencies to be installed: 

```console
Docker: 1.11.2 
```

```console
Docker-machine: 0.7.0
```

```console
python 2.7.11
```

# Step by Step setup guide  Â 
Guide to set up for Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS, but for other Ubuntu version, it should also work properly


Install python 2.7.11

```console
python 2.7.11
```

Clone master branch of this repository for the latest version of Code-Runner

```console
git clone --depth=50 --branch=master https://github.com/nguyenhoangson/Code-Runner.git 
cd Code-Runner
```

Change mode for set up scripts and run them to set up

```console
chmod 755 ./scripts/*
./scripts/install_docker
./scripts/install_docker_machine
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally run example.py file to see if everything is set up properly
```console
python example.py
```

# User Guide 

After completing setup above, Code-Runner can be used as a normal Python package


Import C Compiler

```console
from CodeRunner.C.Compiler import Compiler 
```

Invoke class Compiler

```console
c = Compiler()
```

Compile .c file by specifying its path and desired folder for executable file. Note that executable file will be stored in local computer

```console
c.compile("./test.c", "./test")
```

Run executable file in sandboxing (probably remote) Docker environment

```console
c.run("./test")
```
